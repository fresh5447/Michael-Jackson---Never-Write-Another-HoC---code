// HOC pattern: What if this is a way to share code, instead of Mixins?
// Your HOC is itself a funciton, that is used to enhance another conponent.
// It could keep some state, or data, and then pass that data to your component as a prop.
// We could take info that is shared, put it in the HOC, then just
// wrap all of our components in the HOC.

// 1) We can share behavior - anyone can use the withMouseComp

// Problems with HOC implementation

// We have a lot of the same problems we've had with Mixins,
// weve just changed forms.
// we can use ES6 classes, woohoo ðŸ‘Ž

// "Composition is better than inheritance"

// HOF
const add = (x, y) => x + y
add(9, 8)

const createAdder = (a) => (b) => add(a, b) // HOF
// ITS crate adders job to create a new function.
const addTwo = createAdder(2)

addTwo(8) // 10

// at class creation time.
// The whole React flow is very dynamic
// we have to be very careful up front when
// doing things statically
// we have to be sure that's what we want.
// HOCS do not compose dynamically (not a failure of mixins)
export default withMouse(withCat(App))

// When App is imported, they aren't really
// aware of the withMouse thing..
// Have to pass through props to get message.

// Still have name collision problems. See withCat example
// multiple HOCS on the same component. Sometimes you wrap it multiple times.
// 8 or 9 components wrapping one component.
// every problem is the nail, and every HOC is the hammer
